    // This class implements A* and related algorithms.  A* works by
    // using two estimates from each point: the cost from the start to
    // the point (g) and the cost from the point to the goal (h).  As
    // we explore we calculate the g values and reach the best
    // (lowest) cost from the start to any point. If the heuristic is
    // "monotone" then the first time we reach a node we will have
    // reached it via the shortest path, so g will be optimal.  If the
    // heuristic is "admissible" (and all monotone heuristics are
    // admissible) then h will never be greater than the actual cost
    // to the goal.  In A*, f is the sum of g and h.  We define OPEN
    // to be a "frontier" set of nodes we haven't completely examined
    // yet and CLOSED to be a set of nodes that we've already seen.
    // In this implementation we have VISITED, the union of OPEN and
    // CLOSED, and we also store OPEN, but we do not keep track of
    // CLOSED separately.  We repeatedly examine the most promising
    // candidate from OPEN (the one with the lowest f score) and put
    // in its neighbors.  With a monotone heuristic, f never
    // decreases, so all the f values in the OPEN set are in a narrow
    // range; OPEN can be thought of as a contour of f values, where
    // OPEN is always expanding as the f values are increasing.  When
    // h exactly matches the cost of reaching the goal, A* follows
    // only that path and no others.
